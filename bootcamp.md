Before the .NET bootcamp I worked as a regional supervisor for a company called Swimsafe Pool Management. I basically managed all COA and HOA pools in the state of Kentucky, when it came to service. This ranged from cleaning the facilities to dealing directly with the property managers and the association boards. This job is pretty unique in the sense that, during the spring and summer i basically worked 7 days a week ranging from 10-16 hours a day. It was a very stressful position, but also very gratifying being able to help the customer directly.

My reasoning for taking the bootcamp is to hopefully realize a dream of not only becoming a computer programmer, but also be able to work directly with video game developement. I have been obsessed with video games basically my entire life, and the hope of being able to build one myself, that a little kid might play just like i did growing up, is something that really give me motivation to not only do well in the boot camp but thrive as a developer in my upcoming professional career.

I see myself after the bootcamp doing something in business close to a traveling developer who would be sent to the HQ of the client to not only assess how our solution can help them overall, but also what additional functionality they would like to better integrate our solution with what they already have.
